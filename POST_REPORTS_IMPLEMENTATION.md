## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Patient reports a post**: Uses existing report button ‚Üí Creates detailed report in Firestore ‚Üí Notifies admin
2. **Admin gets notification**: Badge appears on Reports tab showing pending count
3. **Admin reviews report**: Sees full context including post content, author, reporter, and reason
4. **Admin takes action**: Can either:
   - **Approve**: Delete the reported post and mark as resolved
   - **Dismiss**: Keep post but mark report as reviewed
   - **Add notes**: Document reasoning for future reference

## üìä Database Structure

### Post Reports Collection (`post_reports`)
```
{
  postId: string,
  postContent: string,
  postAuthorId: string, 
  postAuthorName: string,
  postTimestamp: timestamp,
  reporterId: string,
  reporterName: string,
  reason: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'dismissed',
  reviewedBy: string,
  reviewedAt: timestamp,
  adminNotes: string
}
```

The system is now fully functional and ready for production use! Admins can effectively moderate the community by reviewing and taking action on reported posts, while maintaining transparency and accountability through detailed logging and notes.
