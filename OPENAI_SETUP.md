# 🤖 OpenAI API Key Setup Guide

## 🚨 MISSING: OpenAI API Key Required

Your chatbot is not working because the OpenAI API key is missing from your `.env` file.

## 🔑 How to Get Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Create OpenAI Account
1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Complete phone verification if required

### Step 2: Generate API Key
1. Click on your profile icon (top right)
2. Select **"View API keys"**
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "RedSync Chatbot")
5. **Copy the key immediately** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 3: Add to Your .env File
1. Open your `.env` file in the project root
2. Replace this line:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   
   With your actual key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

### Step 4: Add Billing Information (Required)
1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
2. Add a payment method (credit card)
3. Add initial credit (minimum $5 recommended)
4. Set usage limits for safety

## 💰 Cost Information

- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1k tokens (about $0.01-0.05 per chat message)
- **Monthly usage**: Typically $5-15 for moderate chatbot usage
- **Safety**: Set monthly spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

- ✅ Never commit your API key to Git
- ✅ Keep your key in the `.env` file only
- ✅ Set usage limits in OpenAI dashboard
- ✅ Monitor your usage regularly
- ❌ Don't share your API key with anyone
- ❌ Don't post your key in public forums

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

If you don't want to use OpenAI:

1. **Disable Chatbot**: Comment out the chatbot feature
2. **Use Free Alternative**: Replace with a free chatbot service
3. **Mock Response**: Use hardcoded responses for testing

## 🚨 Current Status

- ❌ OpenAI API key: **NOT CONFIGURED**
- ❌ Chatbot: **NOT WORKING**
- ✅ Other features: **WORKING**

## ✅ After Setup

Once you add your OpenAI API key:
1. Restart the app
2. The chatbot should work immediately
3. You'll see "✅ OpenAI service initialized successfully" in the console
