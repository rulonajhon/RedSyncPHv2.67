================================================================================
Date: September 1, 2025
Feature: Guest User Access Control for Community Feed and AI Chatbot

================================================================================
                                  OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This implementation adds restrictions for guest users to prevent them from:
1. Posting in the community feed
2. Using the AI chatbot assistant

When guest users attempt these actions, they see informative dialogs prompting
them to create an account, highlighting the benefits of registration.

================================================================================
                                3. USER EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

GUEST USER JOURNEY:

1. COMMUNITY FEED ACCESS:
   - Guest can browse and read all posts
   - Guest can see comments and reactions
   - When tapping + button to create post:
     * Sees informative dialog
     * Can choose "Maybe Later" to continue browsing
     * Can choose "Create Account" to start registration

2. AI CHATBOT ACCESS:
   - Guest can see the chatbot interface
   - Guest can see welcome message and previous conversations (if any)
   - When trying to send a message:
     * Sees informative dialog about AI features
     * Can choose "Maybe Later" to return to main app
     * Can choose "Create Account" to start registration

3. ACCOUNT CREATION FLOW:
   - Both dialogs navigate to root route ('/') 
   - This takes user to AuthenticationLandingScreen
   - User can create account or sign in
   - After authentication, full features are available

================================================================================
                              4. TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

GUEST DETECTION:
- Uses FlutterSecureStorage to check 'isGuest' key
- Returns true if value is 'true', false otherwise
- Handles errors gracefully (defaults to false)

SECURE STORAGE INTEGRATION:
- Consistent with existing app authentication system
- Uses same storage keys as dashboard and other screens
- No additional dependencies required

DIALOG IMPLEMENTATION:
- AlertDialog with custom styling
- Consistent with app design language
- Responsive to different screen sizes
- Proper error handling and navigation

NAVIGATION:
- Uses pushNamedAndRemoveUntil to clear navigation stack
- Ensures clean transition to authentication
- Prevents users from going back to restricted areas

================================================================================
                                5. BENEFITS
================================================================================

================================================================================
                              6. TESTING CHECKLIST
================================================================================

COMMUNITY FEED TESTING:
□ Guest user can browse posts and comments
□ Guest user cannot access create post sheet
□ Dialog appears when tapping + button as guest
□ "Maybe Later" dismisses dialog and returns to feed
□ "Create Account" navigates to authentication screen
□ Registered users can still post normally

AI CHATBOT TESTING:
□ Guest user can see chatbot interface and history
□ Guest user cannot send new messages
□ Dialog appears when trying to send message as guest
□ "Maybe Later" dismisses dialog and returns to chat
□ "Create Account" navigates to authentication screen
□ Registered users can chat normally

AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
□ Navigation from dialogs works correctly
□ User can create account and return to restricted features
□ User can sign in and access all features

================================================================================
                               7. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add analytics tracking for conversion rates
- Implement temporary guest sessions with limited AI queries
- Add more granular feature restrictions
- Create guest-specific onboarding flows
- Add social sign-in options in dialogs

METRICS TO TRACK:
- Guest to registered user conversion rate
- Dialog dismissal vs account creation rates
- Feature usage patterns by user type
- Time spent in app before account creation

================================================================================
                                   CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This implementation successfully restricts guest users from posting in the 
community feed and using the AI chatbot while providing clear pathways to 
account creation. The feature maintains a balance between open access for 
exploration and controlled access for core features.

The dialogs are informative and engaging, helping users understand the value 
proposition of creating an account without being overly aggressive or 
interrupting the browsing experience.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT
